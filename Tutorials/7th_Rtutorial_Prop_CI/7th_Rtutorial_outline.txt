## Assignment

5 points.

In an Rmarkdown file:

-   Verify independence and the success-failure condition.

-   Use the `exclusive_relationship` data frame to make a 90% confidence interval for a different number of relationships (Not 1, I just did that. 0 is also weird, don't do that one).

-   Interpret your confidence interval in a sentence.

-   Suppose that someone told you the true proportion of students in the number of exclusive relationships that you chose is 15%. Would you agree based on your confidence interval. Why or why not?

Knit your file as a pdf and submit it to the forums.
