```{r line-plot}
#Note you don't need a data argument because we're dealing with two vectors, not a data frame.

## Find the correlation coefficient and equation. 

 

```{r lm}
hp_mpg_model <- lm(hp~mpg)
hp_mpg_model
```

The Equation is:

$y= x +  $ 



```{r summary}
msummary(hp_mpg_model)

cor(hp~mpg)
```

## Conclusion



## Assignment 

5 points

Make a linear regression model for `Age` vs `Price` from the `Mustangs` data frame from the `mosaic` package. 

Give the equation, correlation coefficient, a title, and good x and y axes labels. 

Knit your document as an html and post it to the forum.
