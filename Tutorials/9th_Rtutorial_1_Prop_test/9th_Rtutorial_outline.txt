## Randomly choose a data point

```{r random-number}
sample(nrow(arbuthnot),1)
```

My year  is  

```{r Arbuthnot}
arbuthnot[ , ]
```

5.  Calculate the proportion of girls born in London in your year. You can do this with division. Mine would be

    $\frac{}{}=\frac{}{}=0$


## Set up 

Check:

-   The success-failure condition (There are at least 10 success and 10 failures)

-   Independence

-   The data comes from a random sample.

## The Test

$H_0: p = 0$

$H_1: p \\ne 0$


$ \alpha = 0.05 $




```{r p-value}
prop_test_results <- prop.test(x=,n=,p=0.5,alternative ="two.sided", correct="False")
prop_test_results$p.value
```


## Conclusion



## Assignment

Assignment 5 pts.

You are to conduct a bare bones hypothesis test in R with data from a random year in the table.

-   Choose a random year to use as your proportion.

-   You cannot use the first year (1629).

-   Output your test an html file from an R Markdown file. I have posted a skeleton Rmarkdown for you to use.

-   Post the html output of your Rmarkdown file to the forum. See the video and my output for the format.
