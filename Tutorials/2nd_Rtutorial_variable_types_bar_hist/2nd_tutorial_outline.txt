## Assignment

### Part 1. 4 points

In a new Rmarkdown file.

-   Choose one categorical or numeric variable from loan50 and make a bar chart or histogram. You cannot use the `state` or `emp_length` variable.

-   If categorical: state whether the variable is (ordinal or nominal). If numeric: state whether it is discrete or continuous and why.

-   Output the Rmarkdown file as html (be sure to see the 1st R tutorial for this).

-   Post these in the the second Rtutorial forum.

### Part 2. 1 point

For this part of the assignment you are to post a reply to a classmate's assignment.

Do you agree or disagree that the variable is the correct type? Why?
