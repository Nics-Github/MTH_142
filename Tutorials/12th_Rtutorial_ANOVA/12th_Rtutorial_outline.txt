```{r look}
View(yrbss)
```


Let's verify:

1.  The observations are independent within and across groups.
2.  The data within each group are nearly normal.
3.  The variability across the groups is about equal.

To check if the data is roughly normal let us check out the box plots with gf_boxplot() and some statistics with favstats(). Input the code in the chunk below.

```{r help-stats}
gf_boxplot(cesd~substance,data=yrbss)
favstats(cesd~substance,data=yrbss)
```

Change the notation below to match the correct number of means. 

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 =\mu_3$

$H_1: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2 \ne \mu_3$

$\alpha =0.05$

5.  In the chunk below have R do the computation for the test with `aov()` and save the results, then show the output with `anova()`

```{r anova-yrbss}

results <- aov(  ,data=)


anova()
```



## Assignment

5 points

-   Use the `yrbss` data set.

-   You are to perform an ANOVA test to test if the average number of days the children are active varies by race.

-   Before your test you should verify that the standard deviations are about the same using favstats(), discuss independence, and look at a boxplot for normality and outliers

-   Write up the conclusion of your test.
