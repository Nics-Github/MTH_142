## Assignment

	Part 1. 5 points
 
You are to create a html file from an Rmarkdown file.

-   You will use the `run12` data from the openintro library. In words describe the data. (use ?run12)
-   Create a histogram with one variable of your choosing from above (note that you need a numeric variable for this).Your histogram must be broken up by the levels of `gender`. You do not need to facet this histogram. 
-   Also make a boxplot of the data broken up by `gender`. 
-   Run favstats() also split up by `gender`.
-   Do an three sentence analysis using the statistics language weâ€™ve been learning over the last three chapters.
-   Output your Rmarkdown file as an html document and post it to the forum.
