## Assignment

### Part 1. 5 points

Make a new .Rmd document. Then choose another numeric variable and
generate a new box and whisker plot from the `fastfood` data frame. You
cannot use `calories`. Then you will:

-   Make the box and whisker plot a pretty color

-   Add a good title

-   knit (or render) it as html

-   Upload it to the 3rd rtutorial forum.

To see which attributes you can change in `gf_boxplot()` type
`?gf_boxplot`. To see which colors you can use type `colors()` into the
console (You can see me do this in the video).
