This site is made primarily as a reference to text files and videos I made for an Intro to Statistics Course.

There are also 14 tutorials relevant to students studying statistics with R. The .Rmd files for those can be found on [github.](https://github.com/Nics-Github/MTH_142)

I use the `mosaic` , `openintro`, and `tidyverse` packages. Formula \~ syntax is used whenever possible.

The text is OpenIntro's [[Introduction to Statistics]{.underline}.](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com/) is the LMS and has problems from the text. There is a template course on MyOpenMath that was put together by Adam Gilbert of Southern New Hampshire University. If you'd like to copy my template please contact me via the email link above.
