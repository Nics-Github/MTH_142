Formula \\~ syntax is used whenever possible.\n\nThe text is OpenIntro's [[Introduction to Statistics]{.underline}.](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com/) is the LMS and has problems from the text. There is a template course on MyOpenMath that was put together by Adam Gilbert of Southern New Hampshire University.
