More detail is given in the video called \"First R tutorial.\" Your\nassignment is on the last page.\n\n## Exploring the Data\n\n1.  Read about the data. (Summary on page 12 in the text. [More info on\n    openintro.org](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loan50)\n    ).\n\n2.  Load the following libraries and prevent scientific notation by\n    copying and pasting the following into the chunk below: \n    -   library(openintro) \n    -   library(mosaic)\n    -   options(scipen=10)\n\n```{r load-libraries, exercise= TRUE}\n\n```\n\n4.  We want to look at the loan50 data. Below are three ways of doing\n    this. Type and run each:\n    -   loan50\n\n    -   glimpse(loan50)\n\n    -   head(loan50)\n\n```{r look-loan50, exercise= TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}\n\n```\n\n5.  Questions:\n\n```{r quiz}\nquiz(\n  question(\"How many observations are in the data set?\",\n    answer(\"50\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"18\"),\n    answer(\"6\"),\n    answer(\"0\")\n  ),\n  question(\"How many variables are in the dataset\",\n    answer(\"50\"),\n    answer(\"18\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"6\"),\n    answer(\"0\")\n  ),\n  question(\"Which expressions show the variable is numeric?\",\n    answer(\"fct\"),\n    answer(\"dbl\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"int\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"chr\")\n  )\n)\n```\n\n6.  What do we want to learn about lending club borrowers from the tables of data?\n\n## Graphing\n\n### Categorical\n\nTo start we'll use `gf_bar()` to graph the categorical variable `state`.\nFill in the add the variable and dataframe names then run the\nchunk below.\n\n```{r gf-bar, exercise = TRUE}\ngf_bar(~,data=)\n```\n\n```{r gf-bar-hint}\ngf_bar(~state,data=loan50)\n```\n\nIf you want to learn more about `gf_bar()` type `?gf_bar()` in the chunk\nbelow.\n\n```{r help-gf-bar, exercise = TRUE}\n\n```\n\n### Numeric\n\nLet's use `gf_histogram()` to graph `emp_length` from the `loan50`\ndataframe.\n\n```{r gf-hist, exercise = TRUE}\n\n```\n\n```{r gf-hist-hint}\n\ngf_histogram(~\"variable_name\",data=\"data frame name\")\n\n# remove the quotations and type the variable and data in their appropriate locations. \n```\n\n### Go back to the graphs above and add an x-axis label, a title and some color.\n\n\nSee your assignment below \n\n## Assignment\n\n### Part 1. 4 points\n\nIn a new Rmarkdown file.\n\n-   Choose one categorical or numeric variable from loan50 and make a bar chart or histogram. You cannot use the `state` or `emp_length` variable.\n\n-   If categorical: state whether the variable is (ordinal or nominal). If numeric: state whether it is discrete or continuous and why.\n\n-   Output the Rmarkdown file as html (be sure to see the 1st R tutorial for this).\n\n-   Post these in the the second Rtutorial forum.\n\n### Part 2. 1 point\n\nFor this part of the assignment you are to post a reply to a classmate's assignment.\n\nDo you agree or disagree that the variable is the correct type? Why?\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"learnr::tutorial","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"2nd_tutorial.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","title":"Tutorial 2","runtime":"shiny_prerendered"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
