In this tutorial we'll focus on how to calculate probabilities from the binomial, and normal distributions. This tutorial is split into two parts: Part 1 is the Normal distribution and Part 2 is the Binomial Distribution. There is no assignment associated with this tutorial.\n\n## Part 1: Normal Distribution\n\n1.  Open Rstudio and load the mosaic package. Open the MTH 142 cheat sheet.\n\n2.  Let's look at Homework 4 part 1 number 1. I'll type:\n\n`xpnorm(-1.35,mean=0,sd=1)`\n\n3.  To do number 1 part c. We have to do abit more work:\n\n-   We have to calculate the area lower than the z-score -0.4 with `xpnorm(-0.4,mean=0,sd=1)`\n-   We also have to calculate the area lower than 1.5. `xpnorm(1.5,mean=0,sd=1)`\n-   Then we have to subtract those two numbers to find the area in the middle.\n\nType one line of code that will combine all three bullets above.\n\n```{r norm-prob, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}\n\n```\n\n```{r norm-prob-hint}\nxpnorm(1.5,mean=0,sd=1) - xpnorm(-0.4,mean=0,sd=1) \n```\n\nNote: In the video I also go into number 1 part d.\n\n4.  Question 3 part a in the same assignment is asking about quantile (aka a percentile). We have to use `xqnorm(0.80,mean=153,sd=7.67)`\n\n## Part 2: Binomial Distribution\n\n1.  Open Rstudio and load the mosaic package. Open the MTH 142 cheat sheet.\n\n2.  Let's look at Homework 4 part 2 number 1. Here is the text from the problem:\n\n### Data collected by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) suggests that 69.7% of 18-20 year olds consumed alcoholic beverages in 2008.\n\nTo view the graph of the binomial distribution run the chunk below.\n\n```{r binom-dist-plot, exercise= TRUE}\nplotDist(\"binom\", size = 10, prob= 0.697)\n\n```\n\n3.  In part b we are asked to calculate the probability that exactly 6 18-20 year olds drink Alcohol we can do this with the density binomial function `dbinom(6, size =10, prob=0.697)`.\n\n```{r binom-dist-exact-6, exercise=TRUE}\ndbinom(6, size =10, prob=0.697)\n\n```\n\n4.  To calculate the probability that up to 6 18-20 year olds drink we would do `pbinom(6,size=10,prob=0.697)` . This is the same as calculating the probability that 0,1,2,3,4,5 or 6 drink with dbinom().\n\n```{r binom-dist-up-to-6, exercise = TRUE}\n# To get the probability of up to 6 people drink use either code below. \n\npbinom(6, size =10, prob=0.697)\n\n\ndbinom(0, size =10, prob=0.697) + \n  dbinom(1, size =10, prob=0.697)+ \n  dbinom(2, size =10, prob=0.697)+ \n  dbinom(3, size =10, prob=0.697) + \n  dbinom(4, size =10, prob=0.697) +\n  dbinom(5, size =10, prob=0.697) + \n  dbinom(6, size =10, prob=0.697)\n```\n\nYou will have to get creative in answering other questions, if you need help post in the forums.\n\n## No Assignment\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"learnr::tutorial","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"6th_Rtutorial_norm_binom_distributions.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","title":"Tutorial 6","runtime":"shiny_prerendered"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
