We will do it twice. Once from a problem from HW 5 part 1 and again from the `exclusive_relationship` data set in the `openintro` library. We'll be using a problem from the [[OpenIntro]{.underline} Textbook](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/). Your assignment is on the last page.\n\n## C.I. From Statistics\n\n1.  Find HW 5 part 1 number 5. Here's the text of the problem:\n\n*A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made their visit because of a coupon they'd received in the mail. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.*\n\n2.  Load `library(mosaic)`. Open the MTH 142 cheat sheet and find `prop.test()`. Type `?prop.test()` to see the arguemnts required.\n\n```{r libraries, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}\n\n```\n\n3.  To make a confidence interval type `prop.test(x=142,n=603, conf.level=0.95, correct= \"FALSE\")`\n\nTry it in the chunk below.\n\n```{r prop-test, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}\nprop.test()\n```\n\nFind the values that correspond to the confidence interval.\n\n## C.I. From Data\n\nLet's find a confidence interval from a data set.\n\n1.  Load `library(openintro)` in the chunk below and type `?exclusive_relationship` to read about that data frame.\n\n```{r exclusive-relationship, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE, exercise.lines=3}\nlibrary()\n```\n\n2.  It might make sense to take a look at the data itself, do that in the previous chunk.\\*\n\n3.  I want to know the true proportion of students who have had 1 exclusive relationship (aka the parameter). Since the binomial distribution is based on successes, we have to tell R what represents a success. The variable that has the successes is `num`. Make a 90% C.I. for the number of students that have had one exclusive relationships by typing \\~num==1. Try it below.\n\n```{r exclusive-relationship-0, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE, exercise.lines=3}\nprop.test(~num ==______,data=_______,conf.level=, correct= \"FALSE\")\n```\n\n```{r exclusive-relationship-0-hint}\nprop.test(~num == 1,data=exclusive_relationship,conf.level=0.90, correct= \"FALSE\")\n```\n\n\\* If you want to use `view()` or `head()` to look at the data load the tidyverse. Otherwise just type `exclusive_relationship`\n\n## Assignment\n\n5 points.\n\nIn an Rmarkdown file:\n\n-   Verify independence and the success-failure condition.\n\n-   Use the `exclusive_relationship` data frame to make a 90% confidence interval for a different number of relationships (Not 1, I just did that. 0 is also weird, don't do that one).\n\n-   Interpret your confidence interval in a sentence.\n\n-   Suppose that someone told you the true proportion of students in the number of exclusive relationships that you chose is 15%. Would you agree based on your confidence interval. Why or why not?\n\nKnit your file as a pdf and submit it to the forums.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"learnr::tutorial","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"7th_Rtutorial.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","title":"Tutorial 7","runtime":"shiny_prerendered"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
