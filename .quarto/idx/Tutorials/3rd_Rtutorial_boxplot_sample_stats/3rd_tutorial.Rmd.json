{"title":"Tutorial 3","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"Tutorial 3","output":"learnr::tutorial","runtime":"shiny_prerendered","editor_options":{"markdown":{"wrap":72}}},"headingText":"Introduction","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(learnr)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(mosaic)\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)\n```\n\n\nWe are going to consider some fastfood data set from openintro.org. I'll\nshow how to use the mosaic package to calculate summary statistics and\ngf_boxplot to make box plots. Your assignment is on the last page.\n\n1.  read about the data set. ([see\n    openintro.org](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=fastfood))\n\n2.  Load the openintro library for the data and the mosaic library for\n    the functions by typing them into the console.\n\n```{r libraries, exercise = TRUE }\n\n```\n\n```{r libraries-hint}\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(mosaic)\n```\n\n## Sample Statistics\n\n3.  We want to look at the fastfood data. We saw several ways to do this\n    in the first R tutorial. Type one into the chunk below.\n\n```{r look, exercise = TRUE }\n\n```\n\n```{r look-hint}\nglimpse(fastfood)\n```\n\n```{r quiz-varaible}\nquiz(\n  question(\"What type of variable is calories\",\n    answer(\"dbl\"),\n    answer(\"numeric continuous\"),\n    answer(\"numeric discrete\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"categorical nomial\"),\n    answer(\"categorical ordinal\" )\n  ),\n  question(\"What type of variable is restaurant\",\n    answer(\"chr\"),\n    answer(\"numeric continuous\"),\n    answer(\"numeric discrete\"),\n    answer(\"categorical nomial\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"categorical ordinal\" )\n  )\n)\n```\n\n4.  Let's find some sample statistics. favstats() from the mosaic\n    library will spit out the normal summary statistics. You can see the\n    all the statistics you need document for more functions we can use\n    here.\n\n```{r summary-stats, exercise = TRUE}\nfavstats(~calories,data=fastfood)\n```\n\n5.  Notice the `calories` are all over the place from 20 to 2430, this\n    is caused by the different types of foods from salads to burgers to\n    fries. We should edit the formula to break the food into\n    restaurants.\n\n```{r summary-stats-rest, exercise = TRUE}\nfavstats(calories~restaurant,data=fastfood)\n```\n\n```{r quiz}\nquiz(\n  question(\"How many food items from McDonalds are in the data?\",\n    answer(\"140\"),\n    answer(\"540\"),\n    answer(\"57\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"none of the above\")\n  ),\n  question(\"On average which resturant has items with the least calories\",\n    answer(\"Chick Fil-A\", correct=TRUE),\n    answer(\"Burger King\"),\n    answer(\"McDonalds\"),\n    answer(\"Subway\")\n  ),\n  question(\"Which resturant has the largest spread of calories?\",\n    answer(\"Chick Fil-A\"),\n    answer(\"Burger King\"),\n    answer(\"McDonalds\", correct=TRUE),\n    answer(\"Subway\")\n  )\n)\n```\n\n## Boxplots\n\nWe can view these five number summaries as boxplots. Copy the chunk from\nabove and change favstats() to gf_boxplot().\n\n```{r boxplot, exercise = TRUE}\n\n```\n\n```{r boxplot-hint}\ngf_boxplot(calories~restaurant,data=fastfood)\n```\n\nNote the outliers. We will learn how to remove those much later in the\ncourse. The coef defaults to 1.5 but we can change our coef for the\noutlier whiskers by adding `coef =3` as an argument to `gf_boxplot()`.\nTry it.\n\n```{r coef, exercise=TRUE}\ngf_boxplot(calories~restaurant,data=fastfood)\n\n```\n\n```{r coef-hint}\ngf_boxplot(calories~restaurant,data=fastfood,coef = 3)\n\n```\n\nTo see all the things to change type `?gf_boxplot()` into a chunk. Try\nto give a good title, change the color, and improve the axes labels.\n\n## Assignment\n\n### Part 1. 5 points\n\nMake a new .Rmd document. Then choose another numeric variable and\ngenerate a new box and whisker plot from the `fastfood` data frame. You\ncannot use `calories`. Then you will:\n\n-   Make the box and whisker plot a pretty color\n\n-   Add a good title\n\n-   knit (or render) it as html\n\n-   Upload it to the 3rd rtutorial forum.\n\nTo see which attributes you can change in `gf_boxplot()` type\n`?gf_boxplot`. To see which colors you can use type `colors()` into the\nconsole (You can see me do this in the video).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":"learnr::tutorial","warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"3rd_tutorial.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","title":"Tutorial 3","runtime":"shiny_prerendered","editor_options":{"markdown":{"wrap":72}}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
