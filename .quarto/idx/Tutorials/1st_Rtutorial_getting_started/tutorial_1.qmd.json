We will log onto the Rstudio server which lives on a computer at HCC. You can install R and Rstudio on your personal computer, if you'd like, but that is in another video.\n\n## Log into the server\n\n1.  Navigate your browser to: <http://hcc-rstudiosrv1.hcc.edu:8787/auth-sign-in>\n\n2.  Use your \\@hcc.edu email and password to log in. If you forgot your password the help desk phone number is:\n\n    413.552.2075\n\n### example:\n\nusername: nschwab\\@hcc.edu\n\npassword: \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n## Tour of Rstudio\n\nTo help remember all of the things we need for this class, I've made a cheat sheet. Let's reference it to do the following:\n\n-   Make your first .Rmd\n\n-   Keep yourself organized\n\n-   Focus on the name of the file's spacing\n\n-   Renaming a file\n\n-   Downloading file from RStudio.\n\n-   Uploading a file to Rstudio. \n\n-   Copying and pasting plain text.\n\n-   Taking a screen shot\n\n## Console vs. Rmarkdown\n\n-   Scratch work can be done in the console\n\n-   Projects knit in markdown[^1]\n\n[^1]: Sometimes students get frustrated and complete the projects in a document with outputs from the console, that's ok you just lose a point. Totally worth it. \n\n## Grey Chunk vs white space\n\n-   Spacing in chunk\n\n-   Chunk titles\n\n-   Extra: Mosaic cheat sheets.\n\n## Assignment \n\n-   Make first knit .Rmd file.\n\n-   Delete all the default stuff below the YAML.\n\n-   Add a chunk to add some numbers together.\n\n-   Write a sentence about what you hope to learn or accomplish in this class.\n\n-   Save it as your_name_tut_1.Rmd\n\n-   Knit your markdown file as .html and post it to the 1st R tutorial forum.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":{"html_document":{"toc":"yes","toc_float":"yes","toc_depth":2,"theme":"cosmo","highlight":"tango","df_print":"paged","lib_dir":"site_libs","self_contained":"no","includes":{"in_header":"favicon.html"}}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"tutorial_1.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","title":"Tutorial 1","subtitle":"Getting Started with RStudio","author":"Prof. Nicholas Schwab"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
